# homebrew-freshenv
Homebrew tap for freshenv.

This is a self hosted homebrew tap for the freshenv cli app. The freshenv cli app is available on linux and mac 
and I recommend using homebrew for mac installations.

## Installation MacOS

Install the freshenv python package from a self hosted homebrew tap. You must have ```docker``` and ```python3.6+```  installed.

```console
  brew tap raiyanyahya/freshenv
  brew install freshenv
```

I am trying to get freshenv on homebrew-core but I need more stars on the repository for 
them to accept my pull request. Please star the freshenv repo if you think its useful.


## Installation Linux

Install the freshenv python package from pypi. You must have ```docker``` and ```python3.6+```  installed.

```console
  pip install freshenv
```

I would recoomend using pipx instead of pip to install cli applications on you machine.
